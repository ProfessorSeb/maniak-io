In technology, most people focus on the tools. The frameworks. The latest release. But the real edge comes from something else entirely: strategy.

## Thinking Two Moves Ahead

The best operators in tech don't just react to problems. They anticipate them. They design systems that account for failure before it happens. They build architectures that bend without breaking.

## The Bond Principle

There's a reason we admire the fictional agent. It's not the gadgets. It's the composure. The ability to assess a situation, identify the critical variable, and act with precision.

The same principle applies to engineering. The best engineers are calm under pressure, deliberate in their choices, and always thinking about the mission objective.

## Apply It

Next time you're faced with a technical decision, pause. Ask yourself:

- What's the actual objective here?
- What are the second-order effects of this choice?
- What would the simplest, most reliable approach look like?

Strategy isn't about complexity. It's about clarity.
