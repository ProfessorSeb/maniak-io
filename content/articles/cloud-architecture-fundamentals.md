Cloud isn't just someone else's computer. It's a different way of thinking about infrastructure entirely.

## Core Principles

**Design for failure.** Every component will eventually fail. The question is whether your system survives it.

**Automate everything.** If a human has to do it more than once, it should be automated. Manual processes are the enemy of reliability.

**Observe relentlessly.** You can't fix what you can't see. Monitoring, logging, and tracing aren't optional.

## The Stack Matters Less Than You Think

Whether you're running on AWS, Azure, or GCP, the principles remain the same. The cloud provider is a tool. Your architecture is the strategy.

Focus on simplicity. Focus on resilience. The rest follows.
